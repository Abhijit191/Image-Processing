step 1: get a crap-load of faces.
step 2: Maake them all black and white (turning into grey scale)
step 3: Train the algorithm to detect faces.

task1- install openCV that will be pip install opencv-python
task2- To import cv2 library 
task3- load some pre-trained data on face frontals from opencv
	- cv.CascadeClassifier('pre-trained data.xml file')
	-above line is for detector
 
opencv is open source computer vision library 

1. haar cascade is an algorithm to detect faces
2. haar features include 
    a. edge features
    b. line features
    c. four rectangle features
Now lets Train a face detector
1. Start with our tranning data
    a. Faces(supervised learning) that is possitive image
    b. Non-faces(un-supervised learning) and this will be negative image
2. We gotta test every haar features
    -using all the haar features until we get the one which actually match a face.
    - every type, every size, every location(and every haar features gives us a number, Right or Wrong).
    -whichever haar features matches the tranning images closest in our first winner.
3. the cascade
